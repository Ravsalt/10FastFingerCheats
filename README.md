# 10FastFingers Cheat Script

This repository contains a JavaScript cheat for the typing test on 10fastfingers.com.

## How to Use

1.  Go to the [10fastfingers typing test](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english).
2.  Open the developer console in your browser. This is usually done by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).
3.  Copy the entire content of the `cheat.js` file.
4.  Paste the script into the developer console.
5.  Press `Enter` to run the script.

The script will automatically and instantly complete the test for you with a very high words-per-minute (WPM) score.

## How It Works

The script works by directly manipulating the internal state of the 10fastfingers game. It doesn't simulate keystrokes, but rather injects the entire text of the test into the game's input stream and then forces the game to end. This results in an instant completion with a perfect score.
